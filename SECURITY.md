## ✅ Security Best Practices We Follow

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  Secure user authentication with Clerk, and role-based access controls for different user types.

- **Data Protection:**  
  Sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and secrets are encrypted and never exposed publicly.

- **Secure Payments:**  
  All transactions are processed securely through Stripe’s PCI-compliant infrastructure.

- **Database Security:**  
  Drizzle ORM prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities with type-safe queries. Data is stored securely in Neon Postgres.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  All API keys and sensitive credentials are stored safely in environment variables and **never hardcoded**.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Proper input validation and sanitization is implemented to prevent XSS, CSRF, and other attacks.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Dependencies are regularly updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
